# The packaging information for consul in XiVO

this repository contains the packaging information for [consul](www.consul.io)

To get a new version of consul in the XiVO repository, set the desired version in the
`VERSION` file and update the `SHA256SUM` files.

The check sum can be retrieved from the [consul download page](https://consul.io/downloads.html)

[Jenkins](jenkins.xivo.io) will then retrieve and build the new version.
